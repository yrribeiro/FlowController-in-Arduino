Detects if a client is leaving or entering a establishment by using 2 PIR Sensors. While the pre-set maximum is not reached, a green led is shown, if it's reached, the led turns 
red. If someone insists on getting inside in a red alert, a audible alarm is triggered and it's only turned off if someone leaves. A LCD Display shows the counting process.
